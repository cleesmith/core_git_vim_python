remaster steps:
1. make clean
2. make unpack
3. cd /home/cleesmith/tinycore_scripted_remaster_2/src/packages
[don't] 4. wget http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/5.x/x86/tcz/python-dev.tcz
[don't] 5. wget http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/5.x/x86/tcz/compiletc.tcz
6. wget http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/5.x/x86/tcz/nano.tcz
7. sudo make unsquash
    - not sure why this must be run as sudo ?
    - this uses unsquashfs, ldconfig, and cpio to create .gz files that are used as 
      overlays for core.gz ... effectively installing the .tcz packages,
      but note that in some install special handling is needed:
      e.g. python requires a symlink
    - the .gz files created will be in bin/overlays/
8. sudo make overlay
    - mixes core.gz from Core-current.iso, actually from bin/newiso/boot/core.gz via unpack,
      in with the .gz files in bin/overlays/
    - cat all .gz files into core2.gz
    - does a mv to replace the old core.gz with core2.gz
9. sudo make include
    - adds packages from src/include/* to bin/newios/cde/optional/
10. sudo make buildiso
      - this is optional, if we are only after core.gz,
        but it may help to spot errors
11. add virtualenv to home qcow
12. change bootlocal.sh on opt qcow so python is found
13. get dropbear working for ssh ???

... extract core.gz:
zcat core.gz | sudo cpio -i -d
find | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 > core.gz
advdef -z4 core.gz
